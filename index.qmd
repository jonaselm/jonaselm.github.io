title: "Research Progress Site"

I'll add more structure to this site as I collect more results than I can fit in this format.

The links **above** provide general background on my problem setting, current progress, and some additional questions (and hopefully their answers) that might not be perfectly aligned with that path.

### Research Plan
1. Find optimal estimator for underlying dependence
    a. Subordinated Covariance Estimator
    b. Subordinated Correlation Estimator
    c. Restricted Expectation-Maximization 
2. Investigate potential benefits of a median-of-means approach for heavy tails and small observations
3. Investigate high-dimensionality adjustments
4. Applications
